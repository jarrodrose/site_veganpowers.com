		<p>Anything you cannot relinquish, when it has outlived its usefulness, possesses you. And in this materialistic age, a great many of us are possessed by our possessions.</p>
		<p>If something is not working, you should fix it or break it.</p>
		<p>Choices. A river only has as much water as melted snow and rainfall can give it. If you try to use more than that, you end up with an empty river bed. Accept you can only do so much and then choose where YOU want that energy to go most.</p>
